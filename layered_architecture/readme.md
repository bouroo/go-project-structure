## Explanation
- **main.go**: This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the application and sets up the necessary dependencies. It also starts the web server and handles any errors that occur during the application's lifecycle.
- **web**: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving static files. It contains the handler functions for routes and templates for rendering HTML pages. The handler functions are responsible for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and returning the appropriate HTTP responses. It also serves static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **api**: This layer is responsible for handling API requests. It contains the routes and middleware for different API endpoints. The routes file defines the URL paths and the corresponding handler functions. The middleware functions are used to perform common tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.
- **data**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the data storage. It contains the database connection and repository functions for interacting with the database. The database connection is established in the `database.go` file. The repository functions encapsulate the logic for interacting with the database. They handle the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and any other database-related operations.
- **configs**: This layer contains configuration files for the application. It includes environment variables and configuration files for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). The application reads the configuration files and sets the necessary environment variables based on the environment in which the application is running.
- **tests**: This layer contains unit tests for the application. It tests the logic of different modules and ensures they are functioning correctly. The tests are written using a testing framework like Go's built-in testing package or a third-party testing library. The tests cover different scenarios and ensure that the application behaves as expected.
- **docs**: This layer contains documentation for the application. It includes design documents, user guides, and other relevant documentation. The documentation provides information about the architecture, endpoints, data models, and usage of the application.

## Advantages
- **Clear layering**: Provides a well-defined structure for separating concerns. Each layer has a specific responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain the codebase.
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently. Tests can be written to verify the behavior of individual layers, ensuring that they function correctly.
- **Scalability**: Allows for easier expansion and maintainability. Adding new features or modifying existing ones can be done by modifying specific layers, without affecting other layers.

## Disadvantages
- **Potential for tight coupling**: Layers can become tightly coupled if not carefully designed. Tight coupling occurs when different layers have strong dependencies on each other. This can make it difficult to modify or extend individual layers without affecting other layers. To mitigate this, it's important to minimize direct dependencies between layers and use abstractions and interfaces to decouple them.
