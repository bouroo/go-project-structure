## Choosing the Right Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Suitable for complex projects requiring high testability, scalability, and maintainability.
- **Layered Architecture**: A good balance between structure and flexibility, suitable for medium-sized projects.
- **Flat Architecture**: Simple and quick to implement, best for small projects with limited complexity.
