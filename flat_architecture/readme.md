# Flat Architecture

```

## Explanation
- **main.go**: The entry point of the application. This is where the application starts running.
- **handler.go**: Contains all the route handlers for the application. Each handler is responsible for handling a specific route.
- **config.go**: Contains the configuration settings for the application. This file usually contains functions to load configuration from a file or environment variables.
- **database.go**: Contains the database connection and query functions. This file usually contains functions to connect to the database, perform CRUD operations, and handle database errors.
- **...**: Other supporting files that are not explicitly mentioned. These files can include helper functions, models, middleware, and other reusable components.
- **static/**: Contains static files such as CSS, JS, and images. This directory is usually served by a web server to serve static assets.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML templates for rendering web pages. These templates are usually used to generate dynamic HTML responses.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for automation tasks such as build and test. These scripts can be used to automate tasks such as building the application, running tests, and deploying the application.
- **configs/**: Contains configuration files for different environments such as development, testing, and production. These files usually contain environment-specific configuration settings.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the application. These tests are written to verify the functionality of individual components or modules of the application.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation for the application. This directory usually contains documentation in the form of markdown files or generated HTML documentation.

## Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement, especially for smaller projects. The flat architecture promotes simplicity by minimizing the number of directories and files.
- **Quick setup**: Faster development time due to minimal code organization. The flat architecture reduces the number of directories and files, making it easier to set up and understand the project structure.

## Disadvantages
- **Limited testability**: The flat architecture can make it challenging to test components in isolation. Since all the components are in a single directory, it can be difficult to isolate and test individual components.
- **Scalability issues**: Difficult to maintain and expand as the project grows. As the project grows, it can become harder to manage and maintain the flat architecture. It can lead to code duplication and make it harder to scale the project.
- **Potential for code duplication**: Can lead to repeated logic in different parts of the application. Since all the components are in a single directory, it can be easy to duplicate logic in different parts of the application.
