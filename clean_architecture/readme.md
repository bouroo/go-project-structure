## Explanation
- **cmd/**: Contains the application entry points. For example, `main.go` for your-app. The entry point is responsible for starting the application and configuring the necessary dependencies.
- **internal/**: Contains the core business logic of the application. Separated into `app` and `domain` directories:
  - **internal/app/**: Contains handlers, services, and other application-specific logic. Handlers handle incoming requests and map them to services. Services orchestrate the application's business logic. This layer is responsible for handling the application's core functionality.
  - **internal/domain/**: Contains the application's domain models and repositories. Domain models represent the business entities. Repositories encapsulate the data access logic. This layer is responsible for managing the application's data.
- **pkg/**: Contains reusable packages that don't depend on the internal application logic. These packages are external dependencies that the application uses to perform specific tasks.
- **api/**: Contains the API endpoints for the application. This layer is responsible for handling incoming API requests and mapping them to the appropriate handlers in the `internal/app` layer.
- **web/**: Contains the web endpoints for the application. This layer is responsible for handling incoming web requests and mapping them to the appropriate handlers in the `internal/app` layer.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for the application. These scripts are useful for automating tasks such as building, testing, or deploying the application.
- **configs/**: Contains configuration files for the application. These files define the application's behavior and can be easily changed between different environments.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the application. These tests are responsible for verifying that the application's functionality is working as expected.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation for the application. This documentation provides information about the application's architecture, usage, and any other relevant details.

## Advantages
- **Testability**: Each layer is isolated and can be tested independently. This makes it easier to write tests and ensure that each layer of the application is functioning correctly.
- **Scalability**: Well-defined separation of concerns allows for easier expansion and maintainability. Adding new features or modifying existing ones becomes simpler as the application grows.
- **Reusability**: Domain logic is reusable across different applications. This logic can be easily extracted and reused in other projects, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

## Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Increased code organization can be complex for smaller projects. As the application grows, the codebase can become more difficult to understand and manage.
- **Overhead**: The separation of concerns adds some overhead in terms of code organization and maintenance. Each layer of the application requires its own set of files and directories, which can be a challenge to manage.
